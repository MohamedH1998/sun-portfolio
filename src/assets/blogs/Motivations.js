        So, my aim for this post was to see how well I could romanticise the
        role of a developer and the tech industry as a whole. These are my
        assumptions coming into and exploring the field, it will be interesting
        to see how my perspective changes over time.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        In the world of biotech, my experience has been that being able to start
        a project is essentially impossible without decades of experience, a lot
        of capital, infrastructure, and permission behind you (let's call these{" "}
        <i>ECIP</i>).
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        The tech landscape, in contrast, seems to be the complete opposite of
        this, from a developer's perspective at least. Developing software
        requires a lot less capital and infrastructure in comparison to a
        biotech endeavour. Additionally, in terms of permission, there is no
        need to have your bootstrapped project syphoned by regulatory bodies or
        certification boards for accreditation, the only limiting factors here
        seem to be: a. your ability to code, and b. your ability to generate
        good ideas.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Whilst I have no good ideas, having the option to pursue an idea at my
        own whim is something that I like the sound of.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Keeping with the theme of iteration, I mentioned in the previous post
        that the most successful people are those who learn quickly from
        failure. I believe that this framework of thinking goes hand in hand
        with being a developer. As something that requires minimal <i>ECIP</i>,
        failure is likely to happen much quicker and thus increasing the
        possible number of iterations, which subsequently accelerates the
        learning curve. The number of iterations possible as a developer within
        a year is much more than that of a process developer in
        biomanufacturing.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Another reason why being a developer is attractive to me is that the
        upper limits of the role seem to be only dependent on my ability as a
        developer. For a second, let's forget all the other factors that are
        important in an app development process and focus on just the roles that
        the developers play. It is easy to imagine that the best developer would
        be several orders of magnitude better and quicker in developing an app
        than their novice counterpart. Whereas, if we were to compare the best
        lab techs to a junior lab tech, I would say that best case scenario,
        there is a 5X difference in how much better and quicker they can perform
        their experiments. This is because there are only a few number of ways
        you can streamline your tasks before the time-dependent chemical
        reactions become a limiting factor. Needless to say, a career in the
        former would be much more fruitful.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        These reasons that I have laid out are the ones that I think are not the
        most intuitive, other reasons include:

          Continuous Development- constantly at the forefront of knowledge

          Broad field- a lot of room for vertical and horizontal career
          development

        <li>
          Collaboration- open-source development with collaboration from people
          from all over the world
