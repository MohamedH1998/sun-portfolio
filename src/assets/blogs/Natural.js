          We all accept these phrases and those that are similar as being
          logically sound without question. If something comes naturally, then
          surely it must be right, and if it was going to happen anyway, then it
          must be good, right? Examples of these include our unreasonable
          acceptance that gut feelings are ignored at our own peril and a
          mother&#39;s intuition is always right.

          Knowingly or unknowingly, most of us believe in the importance and the
          inherent goodness of nature, but where does this belief come from and
          how reasonable is it? With many &#39;unnatural&#39; technological
          advances like novel gene editing and implantable chips, the gravity of
          answering these questions cannot be understated. Levinovitz attempts
          to do exactly this in his book Natural: The Seductive Myth of
          Nature&#39;s Goodness.

        <h5 className="">Nature/Natural in different traditions</h5>
        <p className="">
          Levinovitz makes mention of how the inherent goodness of nature is
          consistent with most traditions over time. The Taoists of ancient
          China spoke of the significance of ziran, the “self-so”, which
          translates to something like &#39;the spontaneous occurrences in the
          universe&#39;. The Taoists believed that the spontaneous
          transformations (aka natural events) of the universe are not the
          product of any assertive desire or action, and for humans to interfere
          by asserting their will is to interrupt the ideal state of existence.
          This disruption isn&#39;t without consequence.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-2">
          Nature/natural plays an important role in Islam. Muslims believe that
          all humans are born with the fitrah (primordial nature) which can also
          be translated to natural disposition or tendency. Intrinsic to this is
          the ability to perceive the Oneness of God, and through adverse
          environmental influences and/or self-indulgence is this disposition
          influenced and contaminated.

        <h5 className="">Problems with the term</h5>
        <p className="pb-2">
          Beyond the subscribers of ancient traditions and religious beliefs,
          nature seems to play an important role in most of our day to day
          lives, from the foods we eat and our behavioural habits to the use of
          natural analogies to provide support for our beliefs. The more
          naturally aligned our political, economic, and social systems are the
          better.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-2">
          The issue with this, as Levinovitz rightfully points out, is that
          there are many natural occurring phenomena that are not good (maternal
          and infant mortality, disease etc), therefore using nature
          interchangeably with goodness is rife with contradictions. Befitting
          of a Professor of Religious Studies, he concludes that these terms are
          theological in nature (lool), whereby &#39;Nature&#39; is another term
          for God and &#39;natural&#39; is holy. Just as God&#39;s Commandments
          cannot be disobeyed, he argues that Nature&#39;s Commandments cannot
          be ignored.

          I used to scorn at anti-vaxxers and didn&#39;t understand their
          sentiment, however, after reading this book it has become apparent to
          me that we all subscribe to the axiom that is &#39;what&#39;s natural
          is good&#39;, any lines that we draw seem somewhat arbitrary.
          Anti-vaxxers are depicted as uneducated idiots with no care for the
          world, in my opinion, they seem to be people who genuinely want the
          best for themselves and their children- depicting them as maniacs and
          strawmaning their arguments helps no one. What seems to be happening
          is no different than the disagreements between religious
          fundamentalists (anti-vaxxers) and religious liberals (vaxxers[??]).

        <h5 className="">Natural Births</h5>
        <p className="pb-2">
          Natural births highlight how what&#39;s natural is synonymous with
          doing what&#39;s right. Proponents of natural births speak of the
          blissful days of yesteryear when children were born without the need
          for epidurals or invasive care. Many refer to animals and make mention
          of how following their instincts seem to work for them and also point
          to how women throughout history didn&#39;t require medical assistance.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-2">
          Unfortunately, it&#39;s easy for the unexamined past to resemble a
          utopia, but with the slightest bit of inspection, we can come to learn
          that that's the furthest from the truth one. Maternal mortality in the
          UK in the early 18th century was as high as 1000 per 100,000 births
          and is now at 19 per 100,000 births (as of 2016), which can be largely
          attributed to transcending nature and implementing the
          &#39;unnatural&#39; practices which saw advances in healthcare.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-2">
          In the process of medicalising pregnancy to ensure safety, Levinovitz
          mentions how many mothers felt that this transformed a miracle into a
          disease and treated the miracle bearers as ill patients. The
          experience reduced pregnancy to a medical condition, described only in
          terms of risk and reduced the value of the experience into purely
          scientific metrics. In this respect, it&#39;s easy to see why many
          mothers opt for natural births, even with the associated risks.

        <h5 className="">Natural at what cost?</h5>
        <p className="pb-2">
          Levinovitz mentions how vanilla became a staple item in every
          household from when it was first brought to Europe after the invasion
          of the Americas, to the discovery of artificial insemination by the
          12-year-old Edmond Albius some 200 years later.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-2">
          This process of artificial insemination of vanilla is by
          hand-pollinating every individual flower, an endeavour so expensive
          that most vanilla is derived from petrochemicals. The idea that
          anything I put in my mouth is comes from petrochemicals is sickening,
          on the basis that it isn&#39;t natural. However, after little
          reflection I realised that the alternative (artificial insemination)
          isn&#39;t much of a &#39;natural&#39; alternative and as Levinovitz
          points out, the history of food seems to be built on its unnatural
          manipulation e.g., heating, cooling, mixing etc. I tried to find out
          exactly where I draw this arbitrary line and had no success.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-2">
          Producing vanilla from petrochemicals not only democratises it, but
          also limits the number of children on plantations labouring to make
          &#39;natural&#39; vanilla so I can feel better about what I eat. Then
          I guess where I would draw my arbitrary line is at the point where my
          pursuit for what

        <h5 className="">A privilege</h5>
        <p className="pb-2">
          Many around the world would leap at the opportunity to have access to
          cheap foods, even if its origin wasn&#39;t &#39;natural&#39; and many
          women around the global would give anything to have access to
          &#39;unnatural&#39; neo-natal and maternal care. Levinovitz shares a
          story about when he spent time with the people of Huacaria, a native
          community in the Amazon, who were actively choosing to integrate fewer
          natural practices. An elderly Matsigenka women shared her gratitude
          for running water and another elderly man looked at Levinovitz with
          confusion when he was asked whether he was happy having electricity,
          responding yes as they could now see at night."

        <p className="pb-2">
          The modern dilemma of whether nature should be transcended seems to be
          a luxury problem that only those who live in comfort have to worry
          about. Tackling this requires gratitude for the unnatural advances
          that has provided us with the opportunity to have these discussions,
          and serious reflections on our personal relationship with nature."
